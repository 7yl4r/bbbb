The inverter used is the Victron MultiPlus-II TODO: should this be the 3k (30A?) or a larger one?.

Multiplus-II can be installed in parallel to upgrade the system later (is this multiphase? I don't know how to wire this) [^2]

A comparison of the MultiPlus-II vs the MultiPlus:

In comparison to the OG MultiPlus the MultiPlus-II;
* is cheaper (TODO: check)
* new external casing now made from steel, not aluminium.
* more modern circuit deposition technique, smaller chips with fewer integrated circuit components required. Less silicon overall.
* Uses a single larger toroidal transformer, rather than two smaller ones 
    * peak surge power rating is decreased slightly
    * efficiency is increased
* Is physically smaller (due the reasons above)
     * reduced shipping and warehousing costs
* contains double acting AC input anti-islanding relays
    * this makes it the necessary choice for (legally) feeding back to the grid
